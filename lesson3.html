	<p>In lesson 3 you will learn about saving money and banking. Banks are businesses where people keep their money.
		Banks offer a number of ways for managing your money. Below are different services that banks offer.
	</p>
    <h4>1. Savings Account</h4>
    <p>If you put your money in a savings account, the bank will pay you a small
		amount of money, called interest, on the amount you save. Your money stays
		safeâ€”and it grows!
    </p>

    <h4>2. Checking Account</h4>
    <p>Banks also offer checking accounts. These allow people to pay for things like
		rent, electricity, groceries and other bills, using checks or a card instead of cash. Writing
		a check or using a card can be safer and more convenient than carrying around a lot of cash.
    </p>
    
    <h4>3. Borrowing Money</h4>
    <p>People can also borrow money from a bank. By borrowing money, you can
		buy high-priced things like cars, homes, or education, and pay the money
		back over time. When you borrow money from a bank, you pay interest to the
		bank for lending you the money. Common ways to borrow money are loans
		and credit cards.
